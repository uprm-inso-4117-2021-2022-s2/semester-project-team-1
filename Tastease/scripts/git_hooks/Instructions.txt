in file explorer, go to the root folder 
(a.k.a semester-project-team-1-tastease), 
access /.git 
from there, go to /hooks

Now, remove the file "pre-commit.sample". 
copy the file "pre-commit" located in 
tastease/scripts/git_hooks, and paste it 
in the ~/.git/hooks folder

Done, now the git-hooks are working
